LazyLoadLight
=============

Yet another JS async loader. What are the specificities ?
* small enough to be put inline in the `HEAD` : 2K with minification only
* robust and cross browser : heavily inspired by the famous [Ryan Grove LazyLoad lib](https://github.com/rgrove/lazyload/)
* with modules developers in mind : somewhere in your HTML template, simply declare the full list of JS dependancies, your callback, et voil√†
* optimized : 
** never blocks the browser
** download each file only once
** get scripts in parallel for browsers that support it
** get packs of scripts in parallel for all browsers (yes, that speeds up IE)


Usage
-----
Whenever you want, generally just after your DOM container is here, lazy load your JS and all of its dependancies

```html
	<div id="container">Not yet enhanced content</div>
	<script>
		lazyLoadLight(
			// list dependancies
			[	"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.min.js",
				"http://underscorejs.org/underscore-min.js"],
				function() {
					// oh yeah, we needed jQuery to do that !
					$('#container').html('Content lazily enhanced');
				}
			);
	</script>
```

Is Lazy loading efficient ?
---------------------------

If your page is heavy, it's visually more efficient to lazy load ASAP in the source loads of JS files, rather than having them concatenated at the bottom and execute all at the same time. The user sees the top modules enhanced with JS much sooner, and that's what matters.

Future :
--------
* be extendable : add place for hooks
* allow to lazy load the lazyLoadLight plugins
* write a plugin for grouping the calls

Supported Browsers
